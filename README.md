# hello-world
Dis is my hello to the world. 

There are many like it, but this one is mine. My name is Brandon and I am a bi-lingual iliterate who 
love to learn new things and have fun in the process. I look forward to being a productive part of 
this community, and developing many frutful relationships along my journy that not only enrich my life
but hopefully the lives of many. 

All the best!
Brandon
